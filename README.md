# Change Log

# Known Issues:
1: client side will not see gun affects of other clients/host if there is only 1 bullet. this is due to the subtraction of the clip before affects are made.

2: P2P melee combat does not work atm. this is due to all players being the same object just diffrent instances.

3: peers will sometimes not join correctly, possibly from a peer joining before host is loaded but cause is unknown, fix is to use esc menu/restart

# Roadmap/InProgress
